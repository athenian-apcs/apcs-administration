# CT Student Assignments Organization

* One organization for each semester.
* Naming should adhere to: Athenian-APCS-semester, e.g., `Athenian-APCS-Assignments-Fall2020` 
* This is the organization to which each classroom is linked.
* Each student assignment repo will be created automatically when the student accepts an invitation.
* There will be one repo per assignment per student.
* Each repo will be private and visible to the student, teachers and TAs.
