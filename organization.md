* Each classroom is linked to a Github organization, which is where the student assignment 
repos will be created. 
* Each classroom will have multiple assignments.
* Create a classroom for each section, every semester.

## Assignments
* When creating an assignment, use the repo name of the template under ```Add starter code``` and 
choose the ```Import starter code using a template repository``` option.
* Assignment are created from a template repository in the [APCS Organization](https://github.com/athenian-apcs).
* Assignment invitations will have a unique URL.
* All assignments related to a classroom will be listed on the classroom page, but we should
